Requirements: npm

1) Create your repository from this template using the dedicated button here on Github
2) Use "npm install" inside the folder you just cloned in order to download all the dependencies
3) Ready to use. All webpack commands are the common for any other project of this kind but they are listed at the bottom of package.json anyway
4) Enjoy and I hope it would help you starting your Lit-element project with an already organized structure
